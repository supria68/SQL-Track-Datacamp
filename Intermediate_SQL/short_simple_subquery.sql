/*Filtering using scalar subqueries

Subqueries are incredibly powerful for performing complex filters and transformations. You can filter data based on single, scalar values using a subquery in ways you cannot by using WHERE statements or joins. Subqueries can also be used for more advanced manipulation of your data set. You will likely encounter subqueries in any real-world setting that uses relational databases.

Part - 1
Calculate triple the average home + away goals scored across all matches. This will become your subquery in the next step. Note that this column does not have an alias, so it will be called ?column? in your results.
*/
SELECT 
	3 * AVG(home_goal + away_goal)

Part -2
Select the date, home goals, and away goals in the main query.
Filter the main query for matches where the total goals scored exceed the value in the subquery.

        FROM matches_2013_2014); 

/* Filtering using a subquery with a list
