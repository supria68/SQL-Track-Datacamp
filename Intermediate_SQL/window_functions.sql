/*The match is OVER

The OVER() clause allows you to pass an aggregate function down a data set, similar to subqueries in SELECT. The OVER() clause offers significant benefits over subqueries in select -- namely, your queries will run faster

Select the match ID, country name, season, home, and away goals from the match and country tables.
Complete the query that calculates the average number of goals scored overall and then includes the aggregate value in each row using a window function.

/* Rank()

Window functions allow you to create a RANK of information according to any variable you want to use to sort your data. When setting this up, you will need to specify what column/calculation you want to use to calculate your rank. This is done by including an ORDER BY clause inside the OVER() clause.

Complete the window function so it calculates the rank of average goals scored across all leagues in the database.
Order the rank by the average total of home and away goals scored.
