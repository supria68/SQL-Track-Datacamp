/* Basic Correlated Subqueries
Correlated subqueries are subqueries that reference one or more columns in the main query. Correlated subqueries depend on information in the main query to run, and thus, cannot be executed on their own.

Correlated subqueries are evaluated in SQL once per row of data retrieved -- a process that takes a lot more computing power and time than a simple subquery.

Select the country_id, date, home_goal, and away_goal columns in the main query.
Complete the AVG value in the subquery.
Complete the subquery column references, so that country_id is matched in the main and subquery.

	-- Select country ID, date, home, and away goals from match
	main.country_id,
    main.date,
    main.home_goal, 
    main.away_goal

WHERE 
	-- Filter the main query by the subquery
	(home_goal + away_goal) > 
        (SELECT AVG((sub.home_goal + sub.away_goal) * 3)
         FROM match AS sub
         -- Join the main query to the subquery in WHERE
         WHERE main.country_id = sub.country_id);

/* Correlated subquery with multiple conditions
what was the highest scoring match for each country, in each season?
Select the country_id, date, home_goal, and away_goal columns in the main query.
Complete the subquery: Select the matches with the highest number of total goals.
Match the subquery to the main query using country_id and season.
Fill in the correct logical operator so that total goals equals the max goals recorded in the subquery.
